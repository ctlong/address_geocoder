AddressGeocoder is a gem allowing you to validate and geocode addresses. All validations are done using {Google's Geocoding API}[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro].
Although an {API key}[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key] is not required, it is recommended to track usage and upgrade your call limit if required.
Google provides a maximum of 2,000 calls per day to either your IP address or API key.
