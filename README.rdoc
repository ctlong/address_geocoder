Not activated yet :)

=== How it works

Gem sends addresses in varying formats to the Google Geocoding API until it receives a positive result.
Then parses address into its seperate parts and returns either formatted version or lat/long.

=== Development and tests

We are open to suggestions and improvements.
Just don't forget to write tests before the pull request.
